# Laravel 4 Eloquent one-to-many relations error

It works, so here is the code that I use and no problem happened to me.

## Before
* Make sure to create database: l4stack or configure the database in app/config/database.php. The user is: root, and password:123

## Run
* composer install
* php artisan migrate:refresh --seed ( migration and seeds )
* php artisan serve
* open localhost:8000 in your browser
